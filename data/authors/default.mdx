I am a full-stack web developer with more than 6 years of experience. Specializing on Drupal, React, Vue, NestJS, NextJS, and more.
I'm really passionate about web development and consider myself well versed in the "Drupal Way" and scrupulous about details.

I can't imagine myself without zsh, tmux, neovim, docker, minimalism, web dev, Jetbrain's products, focus/classical music ðŸŽ§, thoughts, and coffee â˜•.

Outside of work, I like to play guitar ðŸŽ¸ and piano ðŸŽ¹, take care of plants ðŸª´ and go Nordic walking ðŸš¶.
